How to simulate on the virtual machine: 
The password for the virtual machine is sphere$
all directions should be executed in the VM
1.) Make a build folder in the ZRMS2014 folder
    How to make the build folder:
    a.) Go to trunk ? ZeroRobotics ? Games
    b.) Hold down shift and right click on the ZRMS2014 folder
    c.) Click on “Open Command Window Here”
    d.) Execute the following commands in the black command window that pops up:
        i.) mkdir build
        ii.)cd build
        iii.)cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 10 Win64"
iv.)cmake --build 
e.) There should now be a build folder with a bunch of different files in it within the ZRMS2014 folder
2.) Edit the runzrtest file    
a.) There should be a runzrtest shortcut on your desktop
b.) Under the “user file location” section at around line 9, make sure the file location is set to the right game folder (i.e. ZRMS2014)
c.)Change the starting position of the SPHERES to (0,-0.65,+/-0.2)
3.)Open the .sln file in the build folder

    a.)Click the build button at the top of the file
b.) A bunch of words are going to appear in the window while build is running. Once it stops, the very bottom should say if the build completed or failed.
c.) If it failed, you have to fix the errors. Scroll up to see what errors occurred. They were likely in your user1sphere1 file.
d.) Once all the errors are fixed, build the .sln file again until you get no errors.
4.) Once you can build successfully in the .sln file, return to the runzrtest file
    a.) Run the file and you should be able to see the simulation
    b.) If you can’t see the simulation, here are some possible solutions:
        i.) Make sure you were able to build successfully
        ii.)If you’re still having issues, go talk to Ali, she probably had that issue
5.) After the simulation is complete the data will be stored in a JSON file
    a.) C:\spheres\trunk\ZeroRobotics\BackEnd\MatlabStandalone\results.json
    b.) open the results file and copy all the numbers into this website:
        i.) http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/
    c.) Click on the viewer tab to see the arrays of numbers generated by the simulation
d.) json file can also be run through the resultsParser.py file if Python is installed on your computer (it’s not on the VM)


*To get file from computer onto VM, save file in SVN and update the VM
  -Or, email the file to yourself and open it on the VM
